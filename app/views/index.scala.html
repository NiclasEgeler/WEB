<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>
  Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game. The objective is to clear
  the playing area without detonating any mines. Here's how to play:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on any square to start the game.</li>
  <li>
    If the clicked square is not a mine, it will reveal a number indicating how
    many mines are adjacent to it.
  </li>
  <li>If the clicked square is a mine, you lose the game.</li>
  <li>
    Use the numbers as clues to determine the location of mines and click on
    squares you think are safe. If a square has no adjacent mines, it will
    automatically expand to reveal surrounding squares.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your goal is to clear all non-mine squares without clicking on any mines.
    You can mark suspected mine locations with flags to help keep track.
  </li>
</ol>
